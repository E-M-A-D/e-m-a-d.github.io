                        Global warming is considered a threat to humanity. The consequences of substantial climate change include food shortages, rising sea level and the inundation of densly populated areas and unexpected weather shifts like droughts and floods in areas that were considered safe to these risks in the past. For a lot of today's scientists<sup>1</sup> , human activity is a direct cause to these changes. The greenhouse gases emissions are the ones to blame, to be precise. It is arguably cheaper on the long run to reduce the amount of emissions than to deal with these consequences, like having to relocate all the world's current population that live in coastal areas.<br><br>

                        But as much as it is a global problem, there might not be a global solution: each country produces emissions for different reasons. Some countries like China have a great deal of their emissions coming out from manufacturing, while for cold countries like Russia, the majority of the emissions are a resut of heating and electricity generation. But the common factor for the majority of the nations is that, unsurprisingly, electricity generation is the major source for emissions.<br><br>

                        In this visualization, I invite you to explore which sectors are responsible for the emissions in each country - probably the most interesting one is going to be yours., Given the important role for power generation in producing national emissions, a breakdown for the different power sources energizing the national grid is displayed.<br><br>

                        This visualization starts by an animation for each country's emissions from 1990 till 2011. Afterwards, different metrics will be displayed for the 2011 data.<br><br>

                         <b>Data Source</b>: World Bank, 1990-2011 data<br>
                         1- <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/" target="_blank">NASA - Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet: Scientific Consensus</a><br><br>

                          <h3>Guideline:</h3>
                           - In the "2011 Electricity Generation by Source" graphic, the section named "Green" represents renewable energy sources.<br>
                           - The radial meters below the map (GDP Per Capita, CO2 Per Capita, Emissions Productivity and Total Emissions), their fill is logarithmic and not linear. Their maximum is adjusted to a country that has a high value but not the highest. This was to stop exceptionally high values from dwarfing the majority of low scoring countries over that scale. Also, the meters are color-coded to reflect the value, with green meaning a desirable value and red meaning the opposite.<br><br>

                           <h3>Abbreviations Used:</h3>
                          - kT of CO2 Eq. : Kilo Tons (1000 metric tons) of CO2 equivalent.<br><br>

                        <h3>Controls:</h3>
                         - To view changes in emissions from 1990 to 2011, click <b>Start Animation</b>.<br>
                         - After the animation, the <b>2011</b> data will appear.<br>
                         - To see detailed information about a specific country, you can either <b>click</b> or <b>hover</b> over it. Clicking on a country locks its values, meaning that they will not change even if you hover over another country. To deselect a country, <b>right click</b> anywhere on the map.<br>
                         - For reference, a slider will appear over the map to roll back the year <b>for the map only</b>. The displays will always hold <b>2011</b> data.<br>
                         - Hover over the "Emitted Gases Composition" bar to see the greenhouse gas type and its percentage.
